Validation of Models for Depletion in High Contrast Systems  
Introduction  
 
Upscaling of high -resolution geologic models is a useful  technique to improve computational flow 
simulation efficiency , with the challenges of  retaining model heterogeneity and subsurface uncertainty.  
This work extends the recently developed diffuse source upscaling techniques for high contrast systems, 
(Liu et al.  2022, Nunna et al.  2019)  to pressure transient models of flow, and to determine the impact 
of averaging sub -volume on the flow capacity (half -cell transmissibility).  Examples from selected 
layers in the SPE 10 benchmark model are  presented to demonstrate the concepts.   
 
Method ology: Transient Solutions  
 
The diffusi vity equation , Eq.  (1), describes pressure transients  within a reservoir , or at the scale of an 
upscaling region , with uniform and constant fluid viscosity and total compressibility .

The DTOF will characterize the transient solutions of the diffusivity equation.   
We utilize finite volume discretizations for each of these equations.  The diffusivity equation is 
formulated using a fully implicit, single time step discretization with a uniform initial reference 
pressure , 
0initp= .  In depletion, one boundary of the upscaling region will be a pressure isobar, 
f pp=
, with no -flow on the remaining boundaries.

It is solved using  Dijkstra’s algorithm (Dijkstra 1959)  to obtain the minimum value of the diffusive time 
of flight at each cell,

0=  on the flowing isobar boundary.  Once 
this solution is obtained, it is characterized in terms of the cumulative pore volume, 
()pV .

We now contrast the properties of different solutions to the diffusivity equation.   The asymptotic  (early 
time, first passage)  pressure solution for a fixed rate drawdown  with total flux

terms of a diffuse source  (Nunna, Liu a nd King 2019) .

The diffuse source is expressed using  the drainage volume, 
()dVt , which is a convolution of the 
cumulative pore volume with the diffusion kernel, 
24te− , over the domain 
 .  A pressure solution for 
Eq.  (3) is obtained over the connected sub -volume for which 
  is finite subject to the boundary  
condition 
0fp= .  Flow capacity is quantified in terms of the face (or half-cell) transmissibility, 
fT .

Here, the pressure 
p  is a transmissibility weighted average of the flowing pressure over the upstream 
faces in the connected sub -volume.   In this solution, time is a parameter that needs to be specified , and 
there is no reference to the initial pressure.   
The pressure solution may also be obtained directly from the diffusivity equation, Eq.  (3).  Now use is 
made of the initial condition, 
0initp=  while a pressure is obar of 
1fp=−  is used to close the equations 
and determine the flux.  Again, the flow capacity is characterized in terms of the face transmissibility, 
and again the time step size for the discretization remains to be specified.   
To specify the time for each of these calculations we utilize additional co ncepts from the asymptotic 
pressure solution , Eq.  (6), following the earlier reference s.  At a given time, the Limit of Detectability 
(LOD) is given by 
244LOD t= .  For 
LOD  the exponential term in Eq.  (6) is negligible and the 
solution remains close to the initial pressure.  In contrast, the Pseudo Steady State ( PSS) limit is given 
by 
24 0. 01PSS t= .  For 
PSS  the exponential term in Eq.  (6) is close to unity and the solution is 
locally PSS.  The location of the so-called stabilized zone lies within the transient region, 
PSS SZ LOD  
.  It is defined by extending the PSS region to match the transient drainage volume 
()()p SZ dV V t=
.  For flow simulation purposes we need to characterize the transmissibility at a time 
for which the well -connected sub -volume of the upscaling region reaches PSS.  The extent of this 
volume is obtained from the median value for 
  based on the connected cumulative pore volume 
(summed over finite 
i ), with the boundary location specified at twice the median value.

With this choice of time, the transmissibility is independent of 
  and

solution for the transmissibility, Eq.  (7), is performed on the furthest upstream extent of the volume 
defined by 
BND .  Dimensionless time

Example Results  
 
The above methodology has been used to calculate the upscaled face transmissibilities for  the 
60 220  
cells of layer 55 of the SPE10 reference model (Christie and Blunt 2001) .  
10 10  upscaling is 
performed providing 132 calculations that may be compared in each of the four face directions, two of 
which 
()J  are shown in  Figure 1.  Steady State (SS) upscaling is used as a reference calculation, in 
which the isobar pressures are specified on two opposite faces and 
p  is defined as the pore volume 
weighted average of the pressure, here restricted to cells with finite 
 .  In addition to the PT and DS 
methods already discussed, the comparisons also include PSS 
() t→ , LOD (PSS up to 
LOD ), SZ 
(PSS up to 
SZ ), and BND (PSS up to 
BND ).  These results are consistent with previous conclusions:  
• Steady state upscaling is biased towards lower transmissibility compared to DS.   
• PSS upscaling is even more strongly biased towards lower transmissibility values.   
 
Let us examine one 
10 10  upscaling region to get a better sense of the underlying mechanisms.  This 
region has been selected as it provides a good demonstration of the differences between the different 
calculations.   
Permeability and porosity and the directional diffusive time of flight (±J directions) are shown in Figure 
2.  Cumulative pore volume and the transient  drainage volume are in Figure 3.  The source term strength

upscaling  region  overlaps a change in facies within the SPE10 geologic description with permeability 
contrasts of more than  four orders of magnitude.  The high permeability sub -volume is well connected 
to the I - and J+ faces but does not extend across the selected u pscaling region.  The diffusive time of 
flight provides a characterization of the pressure depletion from each face, here shown for J - and J+.

higher permeability cells, and then moving into the lower permeabilities.  The cumulative and transient 
pore volumes in Figure 3 show the impact of the differing spatial patterns, with the J - direction showing 
good transient connectivity within the upscaling region.  In contrast, the depletion geometry of Figure 
3(b) and Figure 3(d) show more limited connectivity .  Detailed comparison of the pressure solutions is 
provided in Figure 4.  Figure 4(a) compares the source terms (normalized to the total flux) for the PT 
and DS solutions.  Both methods show that almost the  entire  model reaches PSS, except for  a few cells 
with zero pore volume.  In contrast , Figure 4(b)-(d) show consistent deviations.  Both methods agree for 
the zero (isolated) and strong (PSS) source term cells, but they differ for those c ells in the transition 
region.  Physically, the asymptotic diffuse source solution is a purely refractive first passage

approximation to pressure depletion that neglects pressure reflections (Rawlinson and Sambridge 2004) .  
Although the transient times associated with the solutions are correct, the long -time amplitudes may be 
incorrect , as seen  in Figure 4(b)-(d), where the DS solution over -estimates the source strength in the 
less well -connected regions.   
 
Conclusions  
 
Several models of depletion were compared,  and flow characterization was obtained for high contrast 
geologic model (SPE10) upscaling .  Diffuse source  upscaling w as found to be consistent with a new 
pressure transient upscaling calculation in many of the ups caling regions but may over -estimate the 
pressure depletion in less well -connected regions.  The new PT upscaling approach makes fewer 
approximations than the DS calculation and is expected to provide improved upscaling  accuracy .

Produced Water Re -Injection  (PWRI ) Compatibility Investigation s: Comparison Between 
Geochemical Simulators and Laboratory Results  
 
Introduction  
From a technological standpoint , reservoir engineers are concerned  with injectivity impairment in water 
injection projects .  Before conducting any water injection test, it is vital to examin e the filtration of the 
suspended particles and oil content as well as the deposition and precipitation of inorganic scale.   Scale 
generation is a complicated phenomenon that can result from variations in pressure, temperature, and 
pH as well as chemical in compatibilities between the injection water and formation brine (Shabani et 
al. , 2019) .  Each water injection project must include compatibility check due to wide range of  
parameters and concurrent  changes in the  process .  Aside from the e xperimental methods which are 
available to verify this compatibility check, geochemical  simulators are  recently introduced  to compute 
the generat ed inorganic scale types and its amount s.  Theses s imulators are  working  based on the 
assumption that fluids are  at the super -saturation  condition .  For example, a s any of the components in 
the water phase is super -saturated, scale generation start s.  Another traditional way of compatibility 
check is a laboratory test.  This type of investigations is design to mimic th e injection process and 
evaluati ng scales’ generation in different stages.  In t his study laboratory results of the  static 
compatibility check for mixing injection and formation water compared with the geochemical 
simulators and the accuracy of the simulators  based on  lab results  are presented .  
 
Method and/or Theory  
The standard procedure for testing compatibility in a laboratory involves mixing two or three water  
phase s with various compositions at the desired pressure and temperature and then wait until the liquid 
reaches equi librium.   By filtration , the precipitation is separated from liquid phase  and the filtrated scales 
are dried and weighted t o evaluate total solid generated.  Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with 
Energy Dispersive X -Ray Analysis (EDX)  are applied on the scales  to detect  the type and amount of 
each scale .  It is worth mentioning that the accuracy of these  laboratory test s depends on an accurate 
brine sampling at  reservoir pressure and temperature  which is very time consuming and expensive at 
the same time.   
Due to complexity of brine composition and liquid -liquid  interaction s, geochemical simulators  are used  
as computational  investigators  (Jiménez et al. , 2018) .  Geochemical simulators  are both  fast and low-
cost.  By importing desired condition  (i. e. : different brines ratio,  at desired  pressure and temperature) , 
simulators predict the possible scale generation .  Generally, the simulators have access to  a vast database 
of chemical reactions that can take place at reservoir or near surface  condition  and is able to make 
predictions based on stability of equilibrium and the fluid saturation conditions of the fundamental  ions 
(Mostafavi et al. , 2021) .  According  to these chemical reactions , geochemical simulators would predict 
scale formation only if any ions are in supersaturation  condition, which i s necessary  but not enough .  
Inorganic scaling phenomena have three  main steps, super saturation, nucleation, and crystal growth 
(Kamalipour et al. , 2018) .  In this study for the very first time we use  two widely used g eochemical 
simulators , Oli ScaleChem and PHREEQC , and compare  their results with laboratory compatibility 
tests to examine the accuracy of the scale formation simulators .

Case Study  
This article investigates the use of produced water reinjected into an oil reserve in  one of the matured 
oil fields in  south -west of Iran .  The produced water  and formation brine  composit ions are summarized 
in table 1.   
The c ompatibility study  was first  carried out using  PHREEQC  and Oli ScaleChem  simulators to assess 
the scaling potential  of the fluids  in a ratio of 25% formation water and 75% injection water .  The 
predicted scale type and total scale amount for each simulator  are shown in Figure 1.    
Due to different equilibrium constants in each simulator's database, results from the two geochemical 
simulators are different in scale types or amounts .  Although they both predict Strontium Sulfate as the 
most common scale and results Quartz, Iron Sulfide and Pyrite are completely different.    
 
Figure 1  Predicted scale types and amounts in mixed waters in each geochemical  simulator.  Blue for 
Oli ScaleChem  and orange for PHREEQC  
On the experimental part of this study, s amples of both waters  were  filtered with 0. 45 -micron  filter 
paper  to separate suspended solids .  Later the formation brine was mixed with the injection water i n the 
desired ratio  (25% formatio n brine with 75% injection water ) and the mixture was left in stable  
condition for 14 days.  This time is sufficient  for all the probable reactions to  take place .  After drying 
the filtrated scales, atomic  identification was conducted with SEM -EDX experiment.  Total scale 
amount was 134 mg/l and the SEM -EDX results are shown in Figure 2.    
As the result of bulk scale SEM -EDX experiment, Oxygen, Chlorine and Iron are  detected as  
fundamental minerals of the filtered  scales.  Sodium, Calcium and Silicon also participated in separated 
solids.  Based on the detection  of Sodium Chloride, I ron Oxide, Iron S ulfide and/or Pyrite and Silicon 
Oxide are confirmed.   Table 2 summarizes the scale prediction in simulators and laboratory results.

This experiment was repeated for certain points to analyze the scale types .  The  SEM results are shown 
in Figure 3 and the corresponding EDX data are in table 3.  SEM -EDX analysis indicated almost pure 
Sodium C hloride in points A and D while in points B a nd E scale are mixture of Iron Oxide, Calcium

high.    
Results from these investigations  show  that none of the geochemical simulators were able to accurately 
predict some of  the mineral scales produced in the laboratory ; i. e.  Sodium Chloride, Calcium Chloride 
and Iron Oxide.   Additionally, both simulators anticipated large concentrations of strontium Sulphide 
scale but laboratory investigation demonstrates that this scale formation is modest .  Besides,  Silicon 
oxide precipitation was only predicted with PHREEQC  simula tor.  The choice of which simulator to use 
for field development in the case of full -field implementations can cause serious problems.

Conclusions  
 
Due to the numerous problems after scale formation in water injection into the reservoirs, compatibility 
tests are an inevitable step in selection of the injection fluid.  Thereafter f inding an inexpensive method 
beside the laboratory methods is crucial.  Geochemical simulators which are lately introduced as an 
alternative to the experimental methods are here compared to the experimental results from a real field 
data from one of the oil  reservoirs in south west of Iran.  The comparison between the two main 
computational simulators, PHREEQC  and OLI ScaleChem , and the results from compatibility 
experiments  shows that both simulators consider only the super -saturation condition as the main reason 
for the scale generation, which is not enough.  According to the experimental results, one can conclude 
that aside from  the thermodynamic conditions, nucleation  and c rystal growth should be considered too.  
Moreover, the total amount of scale generated in laboratory tests was 134 mg/l which was lower than 
computed values from both simulator s but closer to OLI ScaleChem .  Last but not least,  the generated 
scale minerals p redicted in simulators were different from laboratory results : Although both simulation 
results show formation of a great amount of Celestine, laboratory tests do not confirm it.  Besides, 
Sodium Chloride, Calcium Chloride and Iron Oxide which were observed  in SEM experiments, were 
not predicted with geochemical simulators and only PHREEQC could correctly predict Silicon Oxide 
scale generation.  In conclusion, even though laboratory compatibility checks are time consuming and 
more expensive, their results are  more reliable.

Fracture -cavity carbonate reservoir identification  based  on adapt ive seismic inversion  
 
Introduction  
 
Impedance is an essential  propert y to identify ultra-deep fracture -cavity carbonate  reservoir s.  Numerous 
seismic impedance inversi on methods are used to estimate impedance from seismic data .  However, 
Complicated fault -karst system and low dominant frequency of real seismic data always impose a lot 
of limitations on the ultra -deep carbona te reservoir identification  using conventional seismic inversion 
methods.   Deep learning has progressed dramatically over the past few years.  Many achievements have 
been made in the application of image recognition, natural  language processing, autonomous d riving, 
and oth er fields.  The technology  has been introduced to solve the problems of conventional inversion 
methods.   Das et al.   (2018 ) proposed a seismic impedance inversion method using 1D convolutional 
neural networks  (CNN s).  The method can generate training datasets under rock -physics modelling  
constraints.  Alfrarraj and AlReg ib (2019 ) used convolutional and recurrent neural network s (RNNs)  to 
implement acoustic impedance inversion based on a semi-supervised framework.  Biswas et al.  (2019) 
proposed p re-stack and post -stack inversion methods to predict elastic parameters based on a physics -
guided CNN .  Mustafa et al.  (2020) proposed a joint learning scheme to estimate acoustic impedance by 
simultaneously training two neural networks using different data sets.  Dixit et al.  (2021) estimated 
acoustic impedance inversion using a semi -supervised CNN  with a genetic -evolutionary adaptive 
moment optimizer .  Under the conditions of limited labels  and quality of real seismic data , there are still 
many challenges  for the practical application of the inversion method based on deep learning.   
 
In this paper,  we proposed  an adaptive seismic inversion method  to identify ultra-deep fracture -cavity 
carbonate reservoir s.   The inversion model is based on a semi -supervised framework , which combines 
deep 1D CNN  architecture and wave -propagation physics of classical seismic impedance inversion.  We 
defined the adaptive objective function  to be optimized .  Seismic data and low -frequency impedance 
data are used to generate the inp uts of the CNN -based model.   The model can be trained without any 
real impedance labels , which can remove the limitation of insufficient label s.  The inversion model can 
achieve better stronger learning ability  and generalization , which is more suitable for impedance 
estimation and complicated reservoir identification.   We demonstrated the effectiveness in the 
application of the proposed method on synthetic and real seismic data.   
 
Method  
 
Convolution operation of CNN s is similar to the forward waveform modelli ng that seismic traces can 
be obtained through reflectivity series convolved with a seismic wavelet.  In this research, we modified  
a deep 1D CNN architecture  for seismic impedance inversion .  Figure 1 shows our CNN architecture  
based on a semi -supervised le arning framework .  The input layer can  bring seismic data and low -
frequency impedance data into the network .  Hidden layers  contain eight  convolution layer s to extract 
impedance features  from seismic data.  There are 32 convolution kernels in each of the first four layers, 
and 16 kernels in each of the last four layers.   Kernel size is  generally  same as the length of  seismic  
wavelet.  Each convolutional layer is followed by additional batch normalization and rectified linear unit 
(ReLU) activation sequentially .  The output layer is a convolution layer  with 1 kernel to output 
prediction .  We choose all convolution stride s to 1 and remove  pooling operations so that the dimension 
of predicted resu lts can match that of the inputs .  In addition, the CNN architecture for inversion is 
flexible.  The number of convolution layers can be appropriately increased or reduced according to the 
quality and size of seismic data.   
 
During training , seismic data and low-frequency impedance data are fed into the CNN -based inversion 
model .  Features related to impedance can be extracted automatically from the seismic data through the 
convolutional operations layer by layer in the forward propagation step.  We add up  the low-frequency 
data and prediction  of the  output  layer as the predicted impedance.  The predicted impedance is further 
used to calculate reflectivity and convolve a wavelet to generate corresponding synthetic seismic data.   
The error between the real seismic data and synthetic seismic data  is calculated as s eismic waveform 
loss.  It can be written as:

𝑖=1                                                       (1) 
Where 𝑆𝑖 is the real seismic data.   𝑆𝑖′ is synthetic seismic data .  ℒ𝑠 is the seismic waveform loss term .  
Low-frequency impedance data are used to constrain the network  and improve its performance .  We use 
low-frequency constraint loss to calculate the error between the low -frequency impedance data and 
predicted impedance.  It can be written as: 
ℒ𝑓=1
𝑛∑(𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖′)2 𝑛
𝑖=1                                                     (2) 
Where  𝑦𝑖 is the input of low -frequency data, 𝑦𝑖′ is the predicted impedance.   ℒ𝑓 is the low -frequency 
constraint loss term .  We defined  the final objective function to be optimized .  The function consists of 
a seismic waveform loss term and a low -frequency constraint loss term .  It can be written as:  
                                                                      ℒ=𝜆ℒ𝑠+(1−𝜆)ℒ𝑓                                                    (3) 
Where ℒ denotes the objective function to be  optimized.   λ and 1 -λ are the weight factors of the two loss 
terms respectively .  However, the weight  factors  have a great influence on the performance of the CNN -
baed model.  In general, the weight  factor  λ of seismic waveform loss should be larger than the low -
frequency constraint loss.  Although we can choose the fixed values for the weights during training, it 
may not be suitable for all seismic traces.  In this resear ch, we add t wo fully -connected layers to connect 
the last convolution layer.  They are used to adaptively learn the weight  factors  for each seismic trace 
during training.  There are 16 units in the first fully -connected layer, and 1 unit in the second layer.   the 
weight factor λ can be written as : 
  𝜆=𝑘+(1−𝑘)𝑞                                                           (4) 
Where k is a fixed value in the range of 0. 5 -1 before training.  q is a dynamic scale  factor in the range 
of 0-1 from the last fully -connected layer.  λ will be change d dynamically during training , which can 
improve the performance of the CNN -based model.  Gradients of the objective function are calculated 
and optimize d to update  the weights  and biases of the CNN  architecture in the back -propagation step.

Application  
 
The performance of our proposed method is first evaluated on a  synthetic seismic  data.  We collected 
an small impedance volume from a seismic survey in the Tarim Basin, China .  Ultra-deep fractured -
cavity carbonate reservoirs are our exploration targets.  The impedance volume  was estimated by using 
a conventional deterministic inversion method  to identify the reservoirs .  It contains 5710 traces with 10 
inline and 571 crossline.  We used the impedance data to calculate reflectivity, and further convolve a 
Ricker wavelet to  generate a  synthetic seismic data.  The dominant frequency of the wav elet is 30Hz.  
The impedance data was low -pass filtered to obtain the low -frequency impedance data within 8Hz.  We 
predefined  the k to 0. 7 to calculate the weight  factors  of loss terms before training.  10% of the synthetic 
data and low -frequency data were se lected randomly as training datasets to train the network.  Adam 
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) was used to optimize the network during training.  The CNN inversion model 
was trained 300 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0. 001.  Finally, we used th e trained 
model to perform impedance inversion on all synthetic data.  Figure 2b and Figure 2d show the 
comparison of the true impedance and predicted results on the Inline 1.  It is obvious that the impedance

We also demonstrated the  proposed method on real  seismic volume  with the target of ultra-deep 
fractured -cavity carbonate reservoirs in the Tarim Basin .  Low-frequency data was generated from 
impedance logs  of wells and seismic horizons.  The scale of the real seismic volume is very large, so we  
only randomly select ed 1% of the data to generate training datasets.   To compare with our proposed 
method, w e also employed a  commonly used conventional  deterministic  inversion method to perform 
impedance inversion.  Figure 4( a) and 4( b) show  comparison of inversion results .  Both methods can be 
used to characterize the large -scale fractured -cavity carbonate reservoirs , but the black  arrows  and 
circles  indicate that the CNN -based  method can provide more impedance information to identify the 
small -scale reservoirs.  The comparison proves that our proposed method achieved  better performance.   
 
Conclusions  
 
In this work, we proposed an  adaptive  inversion method to estimate seismic impedance  and identify the 
ultra-deep fractured -cavity carbonate reservoirs  in a semi-supervised framework .  The proposed method 
provides  a practical solution to train a CNN -based inversion model wit hout measured impedance labels ,

Prospective Geothermal Resources in the Deccan traps terrains: Case study from Unai, 
Tulsishyam and Savarkundla, Gujarat 
Introduction 
Geothermal energy is a form of renewable energy that is environment-friendly and reliable for electric 
power generation.  As per the Geological Survey of India ’s estimation , India can generate 10 GW of 
power from existing geothermal resources.  However, the energy resource remains in the nascent stage 
of development with only 7. 1% share in the total renewable energy supply due to limited knowledge, 
technology readiness, and policy framework constraints.  To achieve its objectives of energy 
independence and net-zero carbon emission, India needs to look towards harvesting geothermal 
energy resources through extensive geophysical exploration and exploitation in the prospective 
locations.  
Gujarat is an Indian state located on the western coast of the country.  Multiple exploration activities 
previously carried out in the state suggest positive indications of geothermal systems at the top of 
Deccan trap terrains.  With the formation at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago, The 
Deccan trap is one of the greatest volcanic features on Earth's surface and spans more than 500,000 
km2 in the Indian sub-continent.  The geology of Saurashtra and the southern regions of Gujarat 
exhibit numerous such horizontal volcanic features with varying thicknesses.  In the traps, confined to 
semi-confined conditions exist in intertrappeans and vesicular basalt units between two successive 
layers of compact basalts, under unconfined conditions in weathered/fractured mantle at a shallower 
depth, and under unconfined conditions in joints and fault/fracture zones within massive basalt units.  
Groundwater can migrate vertically under in-situ hydraulic pressure through faults, fracture zones, 
and joints connected to the constrained deeper aquifer, manifesting itself as springs on the surface 
(Kumar et al. , 2011).  
Figure 1  location of Tulsishyam, Savarkudla, Unai and Deccan traps in the map of Gujarat, India  
The present study pertains to three such geothermal hotspots in the state of Gujarat (Figure 1) that are 
located at the Deccan trap dominated subsurface geology.  These areas include Unai a village in the 
hilly terrains of southern Gujarat, Tulsishyam, and Savarkundla in the Saurashtra region of the state.  
The average temperature of hot spring in Unai goes up to 70   and nearly 40   at Tulsishyam and 
Savarkundla.  An extensive geophysical exploration carried out including 2D- 3D Magneto-telluric, 
Gravity, and Magnetic survey were conducted to delineate the shallow and deep conductivity in the 
subsurface of Unai.  The outcomes suggest a large geothermal aquifer system with a heat source, heat 
flow path, and a trapping system (Sircar et al. , 2017).   Later on, a parametric well was drilled at the 
prospective locations which produce water with a temperature above 60   and a 4 lit/sec flow rate.  
An extensive Gravity and Magnetic survey carried out at Tulsishyam and Savarkundla shows a 
84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition 
peaked gravity (mGal) and magnetic susceptibility (nT) anomaly as shown in Figure 2 (a), (b), (c), 
and (d).  The investigated contrast in gravity and magnetic field intensity values at the surveyed areas 
implies a high possibility of them being a geothermal water aquifer with an active heat source.  For the 
calculation of heat in the subsurface of the hot springs stochastic thermal heat calculation method is 
applied.  This method refers to the estimation of heat stored in the rock and the fluid which can be 
extracted by using factors like reservoir temperature, base reservoir temperature, and specified 
reservoir volume.  All outcomes for aquifer volume, porosity, water saturation, etc.  are derived using 
the Monte Carlo method using a cumulative distribution function for the total heat in place.  The study 
attempts to assess the geothermal hotspots with a probabilistic approach that differentiates the total 
thermal energy stored in the form of minimum (P90), High likely (P50), and Maximum (P10) as 
mentioned in PRMS (Petroleum Resource Management System) guidelines.  These prospective 
geothermal hotspots can be a tremendous source of power generation from the heat of the earth which 
will be environmentally sustainable and economic.  
Method 
Gravity Survey 
A direct geophysical investigation tool called gravity includes estimating the acceleration brought on 
by the Earth's gravitational pull.  In the underlying rocks, lateral density changes are what create 
gravity fluctuations.  The tools used in gravity surveys to determine changes in gravity are called 
gravimeters.  The unit of gravity measurement is mGal, where 1 Gal equals 1cm/s2.  The gravity 
fluctuations brought on the sediments and basement are shown by the Bouguer gravity measurements 
gathered across a certain grid.  The survey looks for abnormalities in density that stand out from the 
surrounding population.  After making the necessary modifications, the Bouguer gravity is split into 
regional and residual components.  Residual gravity can be used to explain geophysical anomalies and 
short wavelength features.  
In gravity surveys, gravimeters are used to measure both absolute and relative gravity at certain 
station locations.  The two types of gravimeters are absolute and relative gravimeters.  The direction of 
the falling mass is measured by the absolute gravimeter, which employs a laser beam to calculate the 
precise value of gravity.  The second type of gravimeter measures the comparative gravity (mGal) 
fluctuations between two station sites, while the absolute type gravimeter achieves a precession of 
0. 001 mGal.  This mechanism uses a mass at the end of the spring that extends towards the higher G 
region.  This type of gravimeter determines gravity with a 0. 01mGal precision in around 5-7 minutes.  
In order to identify possible geothermal discovery sites, this technique is usually utilised to find dens e 
or less dense subsurface abnormalities.  The boundaries of subsurface fault lines can also be found by 
using the gravity concept.  These faults are perfect drilling locations since their density is substantially 
lower than that of the nearby features.  Groundwater level fluctuations can be estimated and identified 
using gravity surveys.  
Magnetic Survey 
Finding and describing areas of the Earth's crust and core with abnormal magnetizations is the 
magnetic survey's main goal.  Because of their high sensitivity to the susceptibility of subsurface 
geology, magnetic methods of exploration are perfect for investigating the intricate basement.  
Although volcanic formations beneath the sediments respond primarily, the susceptibility of 
sedimentary rocks is relatively modest.  Together with the voids, near-surface fault, igneous dykes, 
and other underground ferromagnetic materials, this non-harmful technique is utilised for engineering 
as well as environmental investigations.  Together with structural and stratigraphic features, magnetic 
surveys can be used to map geological boundaries that exhibit magnetic contrast.  The two main types 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition 
of rock magnetization are induced magnetization (abbreviated ""Mi""), where the formation follows the 
direction of the ambient earth's magnetic field, and permanent magnetization (abbreviated ""Mp""), 
which primarily occurs in igneous rocks and is dependent on those rocks' properties and formation 
histories.  The unit of measurement for magnetic field strength is the nano Tesla (nT), where 1 nT 
equals 1 kg/AS2.  The shift in magnetization results in a local or regional disruption in the magnetic 
anomaly.  The anomalous body's position, qualities, shape, and formation history all affect how the 
exploration field is magnetised.  
Magnetotelluric Survey 
The magnetotelluric survey is a passive electromagnetic technique that detects differences in electrical 
conductivity across subterranean strata that are brought on by conductive substances such metals, 
minerals, molten rocks, graphite, aqueous fluids, and conductive minerals (Chaves and Jones, 2012; 
Munoz, 2014).  It gauges the erratic changes in the Earth's surface's inherent magnetic and electrical 
fields in an orthogonal direction (Chaves and Jones, 2012).  The time variation is monitored along the 
induced electric field as well as the magnetic field  in the magnetotelluric survey.  
The study examines how the induced magnetic and electric fields change over time.  MT data is often 
captured at frequencies between 10 kHz to 0. 001 kHz, or even as low as 0. 0001 Hz (Vozoff, 1991).  
The results of the magnetotelluric survey reveal resistivity anomalies that are connected to the 
presence of cap rock, faults, geothermal structure, and knowledge of the thermal gradient at various 
depths (Everett and Hyndman, 1967).  Geological materials typically have low conductivity and poor 
electrical conductivity.

Conclusion 
After the end of the reconnaissance survey, a regional and residual gravity separation was done 
graphically and for each three locations a contour map showing residual gravity field intensity in 
mGal was prepared as shown in Figure 2 (a), (b) and (e).  Residual gravity curve shows variation in 
anomalies ranging from 0. 003- 0. 0201 (mGal).  The curve suggests the presence of gravity high which 
is also geologically supported by magnetic susceptibility anomaly map shown in Figure 2 (c) and (d).  
This high gravity four way closure can be a possible geothermal zone which is existing in the central 
part of the map.  
Resistivity distribution map at the depth of 3. 5 km bsl for Unai is shown in Figure 2(f).  The 
demarcated zone with black boundary shows most likely location of hot spots with low resistive and 
high conductive values.  There is also presence of transform faults at some places which leads the flow 
of hot water to the surface.  There are low-resistivity anomalies at depth 15 km below sea level as 
shown in Figure 2(g).  This may be associated with magma which is heating of rocks lying above this 
reservoir.  So they are the possible location of the hot spots on surface.   
A volumetric method was utilized for estimation and assessment of the se resources.  The simulation of 
the calculation procedure was done by the stochastic method of Monte-Carlo simulation.  According to 
a triangular distribution, it was determined that hotspot at Tulsishyam contains 5. 157E+16 J, 
7. 896E+16 J, and 11. 427E+16 J as the minimum (P90), highly probable (P50), and maximum (P10) 
energy in joules.  For the similar type of distributions the values stood at 3. 630E+11 J (P90), 
8. 824E+11 J (P50) and 1. 260E+12 J (P10) for the hotspot at Savarkundla.  Unai a place located in the 
southern part of Gujarat holds 3. 0088E+16  J (P90), 4. 50773E+16  J (P50) and 5. 50016E+16  J (P10) of 
energy in the form of heat.  The numbers shows that the state of Gujarat has got tremendous potential 
to generate power from its geothermal resources.  It can be sai d that Unai and Tulsishyam look  more 
promising in comparison of Savarkundl a for the purpose power generation  due to more storage of heat 
in the hotspots .  The heat produced f rom these resources can be utilized in multiple direct and indirect 
socio -economic applications.

 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition Joint Migration Inversion including Q effects: towards Q estimation  Introduction  Seismic waves traveling through the subsurface undergo various forms of attenuation effects.  Geometric spreading is one such effect, which is typically compensated for in some of the migration algorithms.  Reflection and transmission effects also cause changes in wavefield amplitudes due to contrasts in the medium.  Furthermore, the earth attenuation effect (quality factor) causes wave energy to diminish with distance or propagation time gradually.  While the exact mathematical description of this effect is unknown (Aki & Richards, 2002), it is known to be frequency-dependent and have exponential energy loss behaviour.  Attenuation is also associated with dispersion, leading to gradual changes in signal shape and strength.  As a result, the peak energy shifts towards lower frequencies, which can cause the signal to become wider and more distorted over time.   It is crucial to properly account for all attenuation effects from the overburden to gain high-resolution information on the sub-surface.  The Full Wavefield Migration (FWM) (Berkhout, 2014b; Davydenko and Verschuur, 2017) and Joint Migration Inversion (JMI) methods (Staal and Verschuur, 2013; Berkhout, 2014c; Verschuur et al. , 2016) use the Full Wavefield Modeling (FWMod, Berkhout, 2014a) scheme, which includes geometric spreading, reflectivity, and transmission effects and all multiple scattering by recursively and iteratively propagate wavefields up/down in the subsurface.  This modeling engine is optimized for an inversion algorithm that uses the subsurface's propagation velocity and reflectivity models based on measured seismic data.  The inversion algorithm uses a gradient descent scheme, where the difference between measured and modeled data is projected onto updates for the reflectivity and propagation velocity models (Staal, 2015).  Because of the modular set-up of the FWMod process, where propagation and reflection/transmission are described by wavefield operators, bringing in the Q-effect is relatively simple, by redefining the propagator.  Recently, there was a foirst attempt by Alasmri and Verschuur (2019), where they incorporated the impact of the Q effect into both FWM and JMI.  They assumed a constant Q-value for the seismic data, integrated the attenuation effects into the full wavefield forward modeling, and compensated for this effect during inversion.   The aim of this study is to incorporate the quality (Q) factor impact into both FWMod and Joint Migration Inversion (JMI) by assuming a function for Q based on the velocity.  In addition, we assume that each layer in the model has a distinct Q value and then, account for it during the JMI process.  We assume that a function exists that describes the connection between velocity and quality factor.  For this preliminary study we assume a deterministic function with few free parameters.  However, we envision a process where we rely on machine learning (ML) techniques to obtain the Q function based on velocity, allowing us to apply this method without prior knowledge of the Q function.   Theory of JMI including Q effects  During the process of estimating propagation operators, the forward propagation of the waveform experiences attenuation, leading to changes in both the shape and amplitude of the wavelet.  Not compensating for attenuation will cause the reflector to be affected and result in an inaccurate reflectivity estimation.  Including these effects in one-way propagators within the full wavefield modeling engine is easy.  To achieve this we follow what Alsmari and Verschuur (2019) did in their work, so consider the attenuation factor to be incorporated into a complex velocity, as shown below:   𝑣! =ω𝑘=ω𝑘""+𝑖𝛼	.   (1)  This equation involves the variables 𝑣!  which represents complex velocity, ω which represents angular frequency, and k which represents wavenumber.  𝛼 is defined via the following equation:   𝛼=πf𝑄𝑣=ω2Q𝑣	, (2)  
 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition where 𝑄and 𝑣 are the quality factor and the original velocity, respectively.  Equation 1 then becomes: 𝑣! =𝑣#$%! ""#&#$'$(""#)""&=	𝑣01+()*2%$.                                                    (3) Equation 3 combines velocity and quality factor to model wave propagation that considers anelastic attenuation effects (Toksoz and Johnston, 1981; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Aki and Richards, 2002).   The JMI process is a data-fitting process, where the objective function is defined as the energy in the data-residual, i. e.  the difference of the measured and the modeled seismic records.  The inversion parameters are the (migration) propagation velocity model and the seismic reflectivity model.  With these two parameters the so-called FWMod scheme (Berkhout, 2014a) can be carried out to regenerate the seismic data from the imaging paramaters.  The FWMod employs one-way propagators, usually based on the phase shift operators, e. g.  via the phase-shift plus interpolation (PSPI) methodology (Gazdag and Sguazzero, 1984).  The involved phase shift operators in the wavenumber domain for 2D                                                     𝑊(𝑘+,𝜔)=𝑒%,-'∆/;	𝑘/=90""1""−𝑘+)  ,                                           (4) With ∆𝑧 the extrapolation distance, can be easily extended to include the complex velocity as given by equation 3.  This provides the right frequency dependent amplitude and phase effect.    During the inversion process of JMI, in each iteration, the residual will be back-propagated to each depth level to be combined with the forward modeled source field (including all multiple scattering) to achieve either an update for the reflectivity or the propagation velocity (depending on the type of imaging condition that is used after back-propagation).  The forward modeling of the source will then include the correct Q-effect.  Also, for the determination of the step length – to be applied on the velocity or reflectivity gradient – the linearized effect of the gradient is again forward modeled to be compared with the residual data, in which the Q-effect can also be properly included.  Thus, JMI will iteratively adapt model parameters such that forward modeled data, including the Q-effect, fit the measured data.    Numerical examples  We incorporated the estimation and compensation of anelastic attenuation effects to enhance JMI's ability to provide higher seismic resolution in complex areas.  We achieved that by incorporating prior knowledge of Q in FWMod and during inversion.  Even though it's not completely realistic to have a quality factor function based on the velocity, we can still assume a function exists that describes the connection between velocity and quality factor.  This assumption may have some merit because there could be a link between velocity, density, and quality factor in the real world.  One way to estimate such Q function can be through ML methods.  In our new JMI method, the Q value of each grid is updated in every iteration by the assumed Q-velocity relation, which uses the estimated velocity in that iteration as the input.  In this example, a 2D lens-shaped model with a low-velocity middle region exhibiting a strong quality factor effect (Q=25), one reflector above with Q=40, the second layers from the top have the Q value of 35, and other reflectors below with higher Q values were used.  The frequency ranges from 5 to 40 Hz.  The maximum data offset used for inversion is 3000 m, 1500 m in depth, and sources and receivers are equally distributed along the surface.  Synthetic data up to the fourth order of multiples are included.  Figure 1 and 2 show the result of the standard JMI and our new JMI method, respectively.  It is obvious that the accuracy of the estimated velocity and reflectivity is improved in our new method compared to standard JMI.  We can see clearly once we do not compensate for Q, the attenuation effects imprint on the reflectors and lower the resolution of the image.  As a consequence, the reflectors below the lens shape in figure 1 are barely reconstructed with the presence of attenuation in standard JMI.    In a first step towards estimating Q, we examine JMI’s sensitivity to changes in the assumed Q-velocity relationship during inversion (while the data remains the same).  We, therefore, tested various Q functions, as depicted in figure 3(a).  The results for one vertical cross-section of the inverted images are presented in figure 3(b-e).  Figure 3(f) shows the maximum obtained reflectivity below the anomaly,  
 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition showing the best results for the correct Q function.  Moving away from this optimal Q function will cause a reduction in the maximum estimated reflectivity.  This could be used as metric in  estimation.

 Figure 2 Estimated reflectivity and velocity model with the Q-JMI,  Conclusions  Incorporating the attenuation in seismic imaging and velocity estimation is an important component to optimally address real seismic data.  For the JMI process this can be easily done in the forward modeling scheme, as this is built from separate propagation and scattering operators.  The propagation operator, based on laterally varying phase shift operators, can easily be modified to include the Q-effect.  With numerical examples it was first shown that JMI is able to retrieve a proper image and velocity model, incorporating the correct Q-model.  In addition, when varying the Q-model it was demonstrated that the correct Q-model provided the best (strongest) target reflectivity, while deviations in Q (either too low or too high) yield poorer reflectivity estimates.  This opens the door for automatic Q-estimation during the JMI process.

A microfluidic study into salt  precipitation in saline aquifers induced by  continuous CO 2 
injection  
 
Introduction   
 
Carbon dioxide sequestration in saline aquifers is one of the most promising methods to mitigate CO 2 
emission due to the potential capacity of storage volume.  However, salt precipitation (particularly 
halite) may occur during the injection of CO 2 (both in the gas phase and supercritical phase) due to 
evaporation.  Such precipitation may blog pores reducing the porosity and permeability of reservoir 
formations, which must be taken into account when evaluating saline aquifers for storage (Bacci et al. , 
2011; Miri & Hellevang, 2016) .  The field evidence in the Ketzin gas storage reservoir (near Potsdam, 
German) indicates a one -meter interval of salt accumulation during CO 2 injection, building up extra 
injection pressure (Baumann et al. , 2014) .   
 
Core -flooding experiments are normally performed with CO 2 (gas or supercritical phases) and bri ne 
under different pressure and temperature conditions.  Such conventional methods with CT scans can 
offer a good assessment of the petrophysical properties of rocks and quantitatively visualise salt 
precipitation distribution (Chavez Panduro et al. , 2020) , but observations and insights into salt 
precipitation  at the micro/nano -scale are difficult.  Microfluidics can provide extremely high -quality 
images of single crystals under a microscope.  Limited microfluidic experiments were performed to 
analyse salt precipitation under mimicking the CCS process (Ho & Tsai, 2020; Kim et al. , 2013; 
Nooraiepour et al. , 2018) .  Two types of crystal patterns, bulk crystal, and polycrystalline aggregate, are 
observed at room temperature (Ho & Tsai, 2020; Kim et al. , 2013)   
 
Previous studies suggested that the salinity of the aquifer, the gas flow rate, and capillary pressure play 
the most influential roles with respect to salt precipitation (Miri & Hellevang, 2016) .  A lack of study 
systematically demonstrates how temperature affects salt formation.  Increasing temperature causes a 
noticeable increase in wate r solubility in the CO 2 phase, resulting in a quicker evaporation rate.  In 
contrast, high temperature will normally lead to a higher solubility of salt, which needs a higher 
concentration to precipitate.  In addition, the temperature will also affect the di ffusion rate of substrates 
and the surface tension of water to gas, leading to complex variations of many parameters.   
 
The motivation of this study is to investigate the temperature effect on salt crystallization and 
distribution in porous media during dr y CO 2 (gas phase) injection into saline aquifers.  Potential 
hypotheses include,  
 
1) a higher evaporation rate at elevated temperatures may lead to a faster salt precipitation rate 
and more small polycrystalline aggregates rather than large single crystals.   
2) salt precipitation may mainly distribute in the locations, where the residual water stays during 
gas injection and the front interface between water and the gas.   
 
Valuable insights into the mechanisms of CO 2 injection -induced salt precipitation in saline aquifers 
may help assess preferable temperatures (shallow or deeper formations) for storage sites containing 
similar fluid salinity to mitigate the problem of precipitation.    
 
Since this is an ongoing study, we only present some preliminary results on CO 2 injection at room 
temperature and discuss potential effects  and mechanisms.  Particularly, we use a microfluidic chip 
containing real -rock structures, which is more reliable to represent the fluid flow in real rocks.   
 
Sample and experimental methods  
 
- Sampl e  
A microfluidic chip (i. e. , Enhanced oil recovery chips from Micronit) mimicking the porous rock 
structures  is used for the experiments , as shown in Figure 1.  The chip contains an inlet and an outlet 
hole for fluid flow, where a rock -structured pattern with a dimension of 10 mm x 20 mm is fabricated  
 
84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition  
in between.  The thickness of the flow pattern is only 0. 02 mm.  The initial gas permeability of the chip 
was measur ed with CO2 under constant flow condition s, showing a significant ly high value of about 
2215 mD.   
 
- Fluid  
250 g/L NaCl solution was prepared for the experiments.  Such salinity is similar to the formation fluid 
in Ketzin CO 2 storage reservoirs (Na -Cl 220g/L ) (Baumann et al. , 201 4) and in a geothermal reservoir 
in Groß Schönebeck, Northern Berlin (Na –Ca–Cl type fluids containing 265 g/L) (Milsch et al. , 2013) , 
which may represent the real sa line fluid in the subsurface.  The solution was degassed by vacuum and 
stored in a Duran glass bottle.   
 
- Experimental setup  
The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 1 , where t he microfluidi c chip is placed in a chip holder 
(incubator) that can be heated up to 150 °C.  The whole assembly is mounted under an  inverted 
microscope.  The chip is connected to two syringe pumps, including a fluid pump for the initial 
saturation and drainage of the chip during gas flow, and a gas pump connected to a CO 2 compressed 
bottle to ensure sufficient CO 2 volume on the upstream gas flow side.  In ad dition, a vacuum pump is 
connected inline for the initial saturat ion of the chip and removing the air in the capillaries before 
injecting CO 2.   
 
- Experimental procedures  
The experimental procedure can be summarized and listed below,  
a) Fluid preparation and d egassing  
b) Saturation of the microfluidic chip  
c) The v acuum of the whole flow -through system  
d) System pressurization to about 2. 5 bar using pure CO 2 
e) Drainage by injecting CO 2 gas with a constant flow rate of about 1 ml /min from the gas syringe 
pump to the fluid syringe pump ( Figure 1 ), where the drainage is mainly controlled by fluid 
withdrawal with the fluid pump.   
f) Time -lapse  imaging, where representative  locations are imaged with a time interval of 30 s.   
The same microfluidic chip will be reused for all experiments  to ensure identical flow patterns .  
Deionized water will be injected into the chip continuously to fully dissolve and remove the salt 
precipitation after each experiment.

Preliminary results  and discussion  
 
Salt precipitation in pores at the final stage demonstrates two crucial salt forms, including large crystals 
and polycrystalline aggre gates (Figure 2), which are similar to the previous findings (Ho & Tsai, 2020; 
Kim et al. , 2013) .  In addition, the aggregates contain multi -layers and intra -pores.

crystals and polycrystalline aggregates are founded (the zoomed -in image).

where the yellow arrow indicates t he gas flow direction.   a) initial water -gas distribution and  interface, 
b) small crystalline initiation, c) large crystal growth within the water phase, d) late state of salt 
precipitation, e) water film migration bridging the adjacent grains, f) final stage of salt precipitation 
containing large crystals and polycrystalline aggregates .   
 
 
84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition  
 
Furthermore, based on the sequential images in Figure 3, we found that large crystals grow within the 
fluid (Fig.  3c and d) , but the front of the polycrystalline aggregates can grow (expand) beyond the fluid 
interface.  Particularly, water can migrate into the polycrystalline aggregates and intensify the density 
of the small c rystals  (Fig.  3e and f) .  The driving force of water diffusion might be the concentration 
gradient or the difference in evaporation rate at different sites .  Additionally, salt precipitation mainly 
distributes at the pore throats, which may have a sign ificant effect on permeability, which is un der 
current investigation.   
 
Conclusions  
 
This study demonstrates salt precipitation in “real -rock pores” during CO 2 injection into saline -saturated 
porous media.  Large crystals and polycrystalline aggregates are found, where the former occurs within 
the fluid phase and the latter can grow beyond the water -gas interface.  The kinetics of salt precipitation  
needs to be studied further t o gain a better understanding of the potential effects on reservoir 
performance.  Our ongoing study will investigate permeability and porosity changes during the injection, 
and how temperature may potentially affect the process.  Elucidation of such questions  will help to better 
manage geological CO 2 sequestration and minimize risks of formation impairment.

Optimising the transition from waterflood to GOGD in a fractured carbonate reservoir in 
Sultanate of Oman  
 
Introduction  
 
Field X is in Northwest of Oman, at very shallow depth (crest of the field at around 100 m ss).  The field 
consists of 17 km long and 2. 5 km wide monocline structure with several stacked carbonate reservoir 
units.  The main reservoir is the Natih formation with Shuaiba as the secondary reservoir  [1].  Natih 
reservoir is highly fractu red and have been intensely deformed through different structural events.  Natih 
reservoir is sub -divided into seven units ranging from A to G.   Natih E reservoir is one of the prolific 
reservoirs and is further divided into five sub -units: E1, E2, E3, E4a and E4b.  The reservoir accounts 
for almost 25% of the total field Stock Tank Originally In Place (STOIIP) .  
 
The structure aligned along North West (NW) – South East (SE) direction, dipping at around 16 degrees 
to the North East (NE).  The field is bounded b y a major fault in the South West (SW) and an erosion 
surface at the top, further sealed by thick Fiqa shale.  The crest of the field is faulted & fractured and 
most likely enables communication across all Natih reservoirs.   
 
Waterflood to GOGD Transition  
 
Natih E reservoir was developed initially under natural depletion with vertical wells.  Following the 
unsuccessful water injection trials, a full -scale Gas Oil Gravity Drainage (GOGD)  development  [2] [3] 
using horizontal wells was implemented for the highly fractured E1/E2 reservoirs with gas injection in 
the Natih A reservoir.   
 
 
Figure 1: Gas oil gravity drainage (GOGD) process  [4] 
 
The deeper E3/E4 reservoirs were not considered for initial GOGD deployment for their low fracture 
density.  Waterflood development was implemented for the E3/E4 reservoirs starting 1997 using 
horizontal wells  [4] [5] [6].  Water injection assisted in recovering back the production for the followed 
by rapid increase in water cut reaching up to 80% in 2007.   
  
Following an extensive review, a new Field Development Plan (FDP) was implemented for E reservoir 
in 2010, which propo sed for conversion of hybrid GOGD/water injection development to a full -scale 
GOGD development across all sub -units.  The FDP proposed dedicated gas injection in the reservoir for 
faster transition to GOGD followed by progressive reduction of water injectio n for E3/E4 reservoirs to 
protect against oil re -imbibition.   
 
New crestal gas injectors were drilled, and dedicated gas injection was initiated from 2009 onwards 
from the crest at a depth of ~ 300 m TVDss.  Water injection in the reservoir completely stopp ed in 
2016.  New oil producers were drilled at final rim location at a depth of 480 to 500 m TVDss to recover 
oil through the GOGD process.  Further transitional wells (floor wells) were also added in many areas 
 
 
 
84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition  
at depths ranging from 430 to 450 m TVDss to s upplement the GOGD recovery.  Many of the existing 
oil producers were also repurposed as transitional wells and final rim wells.  The GOGD recovery 
mechanism has helped in recovering back production from the reservoir.  Water cut in the reservoir has 
reduced validating the successful transition from water flood to GOGD.   
 
 
Figure 2: Plumbing diagram in GOGD process  
 
Optimisation of GOGD Development  
 
The transition process was conceptually challenging as studies indicated oil loss due t o re-imbibition 
into matrix blocks.  A gradual reduction in water injection was implemented to prevent oil to re -imbibe 
into waterflood matrix block.   
 
Long horizontal final rim producers and transitional wells to draw the gas towards the final rim 
producer s.  New seismic data and logs suggested many wells inadvertently crossed large fracture 
corridors.  Many of these wells eventually saw gas breakthrough.  An optimisation program called for 
identification of fracture zones and eventually redrilling these wells  as split wells to continue GOGD.   
  
New data also indicated aerial variability in fracture density.  Few sectors suffered from poor GOGD 
performance.  Additional transitional wells were drilled to enhance the gas flows toward the rim wells.  
This helped in ac celerating GOGD transition.   
 
 
Figure 3: GOGD optimisation strategies  
 
 
 
 
 
84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition  
The transition from waterflood to GOGD also left -over large volume of injected water in the reservoir 
inhibiting gas movement towards rim wells.  The optimisation plans included reopening of the old 
injectors as producers and drilling new set of rim lowering wells  [8] to draw out injected water as well 
as produce incrementally from oil -water transition zone.   
 
Figure 4: Rim lowering well conceptual model  
 
Fracture density is higher the central area of the field resulting in smaller size matrix blocks  (SMBs) .  
Matrix blocks in this area are small with average dimensions of 200 m x 100 m.  Previously dr illed 
horizontal wells in this area are producing at high Gas Oil Ratio (GOR) .  In many cases, it  is challenging 
to plan replacement horizontal wells avoiding Alpine II fractures.  As such, a vertical/slanted well 
development is proposed to enhance recovery and reduce the gap to Top Quartile (TQ) recovery  
 
It is difficult to conclude if historical production from horizonal wells effectively depleted the SMBs.  
Hence, large uncertainty exists in remaining oil saturation in SMBs.  An appraisal plan was developed 
to test the vertical /slanted development concept in the GOGD system and thus further enhance recovery 
from the field.   
 
 
Figure 5: Small matrix block opportunities  
 
Further, WRFM interventions were implemented in field with operations like surface gas breakthrough 
controllers, gas shut -off, downhole autonomous gas control valves to manage transitional wells as GOR 
rose.   
 
Results, Observations, Conclusions  
 
 
 
84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition  
 
The transition from waterflood to GOGD over 5 years has been smooth an d a successful reversal of 
water cut in wells in most areas have been observed.  The gradual reductio of water injection and onset 
of gas injection has helped in minimizing oil re -imbibition as well as maintaining the reservoir ratio to 
expectation level  
 
The optimisation adjustments with active WRFM intervention, additional transitional wells, re -drilling 
wells and rim lowering has helped in greatly enhancing the efficiency of GOGD process and reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the field.  This has ac celerated oil production and reduce gap to 
top quartile (TQ) recovery.   
 
Novel/Additive Information  
 
The case study describes a successful transition of drive mechanism in a mature field.  A co -ordinated 
WRFM strategy, data collection and action initiation h as helped to optimise the transition and achieve 
higher recovery.  The FDP implementation serves as a template for similar transition in other fields 
worldwide.

 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition Investigation and Assessment of Technical and Economic Viability of CCUS Project in Scotian Shelf, Canada  Introduction  Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration is a technique to store CO2 into underground formations.  Successful CO2 storage into underground formations depends on many factors such as efficient sealing, no escaping from the storage, and minimum corrosion to injection tubing/casing.  Therefore, proper planning involving a thorough study of reaction kinetics of CO2 with the underground formation is necessary.   Trapping mechanism has lot of importance in evaluating CO2 sequestration process.  Four trapping mechanisms can be identified in CO2 sequestration, which are: structural, solubility, residual, and mineral trapping.  Structural trapping is the primary CO2 geo-storage mechanism in which the CO2 is permanently kept immobilized beneath a cap rock by a balance between buoyancy force and capillary force.  Solubility trapping involves the dissolution of CO2 into the fluids present in the formation (oil and water), which depends upon brine salinity, temperature, and pressure.  Residual gas trapping consists of storing CO2 as an immobile gas in the porous media as a result of capillary pressure where relative permeability to CO2 becomes zero.  While in mineral trapping, the CO2 is trapped as a precipitate of carbonate minerals by interaction with metal cations (predominantly Ca2+, Fe2+, and Mg2+) and is considered the most secure trapping mechanism (IPCC, 2005).   Different researchers have studied the potential of geological basins to store CO2.  Herzog (2001) assessed the potential of CO2 sequestration through giving the real example of silepner oil and gas field and concluded that capturing CO2 from power plant that produces high amount of CO2, will be able to reduce the CO2 emission.  In addition, Beecy and Kuuskraa (2001) used “Low-Carbon World” approach which envisioned significantly greater advances in energy that involves the increased use of renewables and nuclear energy resources and a “High-Carbon World” approach with less emphasis on energy efficiency, renewables, and producing hydrocarbons at same time.  They concluded that in the High-Carbon World case, sequestration needs to provide over 400 million tons of carbon emissions reduction in 2020 and over 1900 million tons of carbon per year in 2050.  Furthermore, Bradshaw and Dance (2005) conducted studies to assess the CO2 storage capacity worldwide in the earth.  They reported that the geographical and technical relationships between emission sites and storage locations as well as the economic drivers affect the degree to which geological storage of CO2 will be implemented in the future.  In addition, they reported that major petroleum provinces are the most likely place for CO2 storage to occur.   Moreover, Craig et al.  (2014) compared the use of volumetric and dynamic estimation for CO2 storage in deep saline water.  Results from their work demonstrated that using suitable method (volumetric and dynamic), storage terms (open or closed system), and duration of CO2 injection can be used to gain appropriate CO2 storage efficiency.  Based on the dynamic results, for open system condition, CO2 storage efficiency would be 0. 55% to 1. 67% as opposed to 0. 21% in a closed system.  Furthermore, another study conducted by Guo et al.  (2019) in which the influence of CO2 and nanoparticle stabilized foam injection was examined to evaluate CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers using microfluidic device saturated with brine.  It was determined that foam injection showed a substantial increment in the CO2 storage up to 40% more than gas injection.  Thus, using nanoparticle is vital in keeping the foam quality, reducing possible leaks, and maintaining a safe CO2 storage system.   In this research study, qualitative and quantitative assessment of the capacity of potential storage options of CO2 in Scotian Shelf was conducted using the volumetric and material balance methods.  The volumetric study was conducted on four deep saline aquifers using the data from geological maps, seismic, well logging and core analysis considering the storage efficiency of each of the examined aquifers.  After that, the CO2 storage capacity of six depleted gas fields was determined using the production data where analytical equations was applied.  Meanwhile, the CO2 storage capacity of other depleted and stranded fields was determined using published data available in previous work.  Finally, the risk analysis and surface facilities design were conducted, and economic evaluation was performed.   
 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition Geological Overview  Scotian Basin is located on the coast of Nova Scotia in Canada and extends for about 1,200 km from the Yarmouth Arch / United States border in the southwest to the Avalon Uplift on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland in the northeast.  The total basin area is 300,000 km2 including a part on the passive continental margin.  During the syn-rift phase (mid-Triassic), dominance of red beds and evaporate deposits occurred while grabens acted as loci for the clastic deposition.  Afterwards, a break-up unconformity (BU) resulted which was coinciding with the final separation of Africa and North America.  The BU resulted in a heavily graben faults and complex terranes of basement with highs along the Scotian margin which underwent a significant degree on peneplanation.  Western uplift resulted in an influx of clastic sediments along with carbonate deposition and establishment mixed energy in Laurentian Subbasin, and slightly later in the Sable Subbasin (Sable Delta complex).  Similar progradation in the southwestern region close to US-Canada border called Shelburne Delta.  These sediments originated from Gulf of St.  Lawrence region of latest Devonian to Permian sediments (Pe-Piper and Piper, 2004; Pe-Piper and MacKay, 2006).  First phase of delta progradation into those subbasins recorded by MicMac formation proved by channel distribution and delta front fluvial sands cyclically interfingering with pro-delta and shelf marine shales of the Verrill Canyon Formation.  The establishing of St.  Lawrence River in early Cretaceous led to increase the clastics in Scotian Basin and covering the carbonates of La Have and Banquereau Platforms.  Within the same period, Missisauga formation founded with mainly thick sand-rich, carbonate shoals, and shallow marine shelf successions.  Sable Delta progradation covered several subbasements and platforms, while Shelburne Delta disappeared due to the exhaustion of its river's sediment supply.  Instability of cretaceous and mid-Jurassic sediment deposition along the shelf caused subsidence and seaward-dipping development (act as trap).  As a result of that sediment loading, salt mobilized to form complex morphologies.  Shelf-edge delta complexes formed at the edges of the continental shelf along with rivers that incised exposed outer shelf sediments during low sea level periods (Cummings and Arnott, 2005; 2006).  Complex delta provided turbidity associated with other mass transport deposits to the slope, opening the path to have potential reservoirs in canyons and intra-slope mini basins during Mid-Jurassic to Cretaceous.   During late early cretaceous the shelf was covered by thick shale succession called Naskapi which is a member of the Logan Canyon caused by marine transgression.  This shale has been interbedded periodically by coarser classics (Cree and Marmora members) during Aptian-Cenomanian.  Low relief morphology allows deep marine shales and limestones to accumulate and cover the sand that deposited along coastal plain.  Scotian basin faced increase in sea level at the end of cretaceous which encourage marine marls and chalky mudstones deposits (Wyandot Formation).  Eventually these deposits buried by Banuereau formation (Tertiary mudstones & conglomerates).  Unconsolidated sediments were eroded and transported by fluvial into deep water and abyssal plain when sea level fall at the margin.  Late tertiary period, glacial and marine sediments took place for hundred meters along the outer shelf and upper slope.   Methodology  The workflow followed in this study is shown in Figure 1 where it starts with collecting data from different sources including seismic, well logging, core analysis, well data, and geological maps (structure contour, facies, and isopach).  After that, data have been analysed and reservoir characterization have been conducted.  One should note that suitable values have been assumed from previous studies for any missing parameters.  After that, a volumetric study has been performed for each formation of the saline aquifers where first geological model was built (structural framework) then shale volume and facies attributes (porosity and permeability) were determined.  Then, pore volume has been converted to storage capacity using a storage efficiency, which depends on the characteristics of each aquifer and formations, using the following equation (Halland et al. , 2013):  𝑀=𝑃𝑉×𝐸×𝜌! ""! ,                                                                                                                    (1)   
 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition where M is amount of CO2 in tons, PV is pore volume, E is storage efficiency, and 𝜌! ""!  is density of CO2.  Afterwards, a seal evaluation study was performed to ensure safe and secure storage of CO2 in different aquifers.  Once the seal evaluation is performed, risk analysis has been determined using Pallisade @risk simulator.   
 Figure 1 Workflow for CO2 storage potential evaluation of Scotian Shelf.   Then, for calculating the CO2 storage potential for the depleted gas fields, the following material balance equation was used (Gammer et al. , 2011):  𝐶𝑂#	𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦	(𝑀𝑇)=4𝐺$	×𝐵%+𝑊&×𝐵'−𝐺(×𝐵%:𝜌! ""! ,                                                 (2)  where 𝐺$ is cumulative gas production, 𝐵% is gas formation volume factor, 𝑊& is the Cumulative water production, 𝐵' is formation volume factor, 𝐺( gas injection, and 𝜌! ""!  is density of CO2.   On the other hand, for calculating the CO2 storage potential for other depleted and stranded fields, the following equation was used:  𝑀! ""#)=𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑎𝑠*)$×𝐵%×𝜌𝐶𝑂2#+,                                                                                             (3)  where 𝑀! ""#) is the mass of CO2 stored in tons,  𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑎𝑠*)$ is the ultimate recoverable reserves of gas at standard conditions data, 𝐵% is the gas formation volume factor, 𝜌𝐶𝑂2#+ is density of CO2 at reservoir conditions in ton per m3.  Furthermore, the surface facilities design and monitoring system were conducted.  Finally, the economic analysis of the whole process was performed.   Conclusions  In this research, the CO2 sequestration potential of Scotian Shelf was successfully evaluated.  Based on the findings of this study, the following conclusions can be made: • Different potential storage options were assessed i. e. , deep saline aquifers, depleted gas fields, and stranded fields in the Scotian Shelf based on the volumetric and material balance approaches.  
 
 84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition • After an extensive thorough investigation, the Scotian Shelf showed a high prospective site to store around 660 Gtons of CO2.  • For the monitoring and surface facilities design for CO2 sequestration potential in Scotian Shelf, integrated and energy-efficient compression system that is powered by wind energy is recommended for this project.  • Based on the economic analysis and evaluation, an annual emission of around 12 Mtons of CO2 is produced from nearby areas near Scotian Shelf.  A profit of US$ 2 billion can be generated if the produced CO2 is captured and stored.
